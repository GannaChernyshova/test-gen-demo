Since the provided class structure doesn't have any methods or services, the test class will be quite simple. Here is a basic example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Testcontainers;

@Testcontainers
public class CustomerTest {

    @Container
    private final Customer customer = new Customer();

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // Initialize your test setup here
    }

    @AfterEach
    public void tearDown() {
        // Clean up your test here
    }

    @Test
    public void testCustomer() {
        // Test your methods here
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't do much as the provided class structure doesn't have any methods or services. You would need to add your own setup, teardown, and test methods based on your actual requirements.
